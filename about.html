    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div id="About">
        <p>My name is Ryan Fahey, and I am a junior at the University of Oklahoma from Chicago, Illinois. I am currently completing both my undergraduate and graduate degrees in management information systems, with a minor in finance, and am expecting to complete both degrees in May 2021, where upon graduation, I am interested in taking a role in data analytics. In addition to my educational experience, I am also involved in student organizations such as our undergraduate mock trial team, where we compete across the country in presenting court cases, and The Price College of Businessâ€™ JCPenny Leadership program, a highly selective program that focuses on developing professional skills that are essential to career success. My experience in these activities has allowed me to develop communication and critical thinking skills that complement my technical experience I have developed through my education. I believe that my experience and roles on campus can allow me to be a valuable asset to your company.  </p>
